             While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth   sustains liquid surface water.
            About 71% of Earth's  surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes and rivers.</div>

                was the only color that we could see, a very fragile  looking Earth, a very delicate looking Earth, I was immediately 
                almost overcome by the thought  that here we came all this way to the Moon, and yet the most significant  thing we're 
                seeing is our own home planet, the Earth.
